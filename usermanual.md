# User Manual For Sam


### Conditions I like to work in

* I'm low maintenance and happy to work anywhere. 

* Generally I like a feeling of energy and buzz and feed off that. I have a high tolerance for noise - if I need somewhere quiet then I'll take myself off to a private space. 

* I don't like to be chained to my desk and like to float, move around and collaborate with others. 

* I often like to partner with people to get quick feedback or get different perspectives.
* I value the opportunity to work remotely for part of the week to have the opportunity to take my children to school, have dinner as a family etc but also to have a break from the commute and the distractions that you inevitably experience in an office environment.


### The times/Hours I like to work

* I've got a young family (3 children) so I really value getting home on time to read them a story and help put them to bed. It also means that I'm up early so I prefer to start my day earlier, by 8am and to leave by 5pm to catch the train home. 

* This means that I generally don't like meetings past 4pm due to the risk of overrun and if I need to finish something before the end of the day. 

* I do, however, have a long commute so I often use this time to do anything that requires particular focus so I can maximise the time in the office for those things that require collaboration. If the thing you're waiting for from me is one of those I'll let you know!
* If I message you outside of your working hours on my commute please do not feel the need to reply until you're back in work.


### The best ways to communicate with me

* For the last three years I've been working on an instant messaging platform for financial services so I've not really used email for some time now! Slack is, therefore, the best option. 

* In the rare event you need an immediate answer from me either come and find me or drop me a text/WhatsApp. I won't always answer the phone immediately if you call me.

* If you want to talk to me about something I prefer to know what it is in advance rather than simply 'have you got 5 minutes?'. Generally I don't like surprises!


### The ways I like to receive feedback

* I prefer feedback in person; one to one rather than in a group.

* I don't have an issue with difficult conversations. I appreciate straight, direct communication. Say what you are thinking, and don't sugar coat it. 

* I like to receive feedback from anyone. I see all feedback as a learning opportunity so I like any feedback to include examples and also suggestions on how I / it could be better/different.


### Things I need

* Tea - I'll be honest I average 10 cups a day. 

* Frequent breaks - I like to work in short bursts and have often found the pomodoro time management technique very effective.

* A clear purpose and autonomy. 

* Positive, can-do approach. 
* Honesty, openness and transparency.

* To be challenged and stretched, not only by the problem or the company but also my colleagues.

* Space to experiment, run with ideas, fail and learn. 

* Laughter - I always try to see the funny side in any situation. Humour is really important to me and I often use it to deal with stressful situations.


### Things I struggle with

* People not doing what they say will - I'm delivery and execution focused.

* Discussions without decisions.

* Excuses - take responsibility and fix it. 

* Silos - I'm focused on solving problems and those problems almost always cross boundaries.


### Things I love

* I absolutely love learning - I like to be self-sufficient and I'll often get you to show me how to do something rather so next time I can do it myself rather than ask you.

* Working in the open - I enjoy sharing what we do and how we do it.

* Hearing about what other people are working on.

* Celebrating wins - I think this is important and I'm often the cheerleader for the team. 

* Doing interesting work that has an impact and makes a difference. It's always more than a 'job' for me.



### Other things to know about me

* My mantra in life is **ask for forgiveness not permission**.

* I like data but I'm not driven by data. I usually like being informed by data when making a decision but I'm not driven by it. I use my intuition to tell me when the data might be wrong. 

* I don't have a developer background (read Law at University) but the people I've worked with often describe  me as 'technical'. I'm familiar with many lean/agile/XP technical practices and have been writing some JavaScript and python recently deploying it to AWS using the Serverless Framework consuming services such as Lambda, dyanamoDB, SNS, API gateway, x-ray, cloudwatch etc. If I don't understand what you're saying I won't be afraid to say and ask. 
* I'm a football fan (Bristol Rovers supporter, Up the Gas!) and always enjoy talking about it if you're also interested. Before children I was a football referee and rose through the ranks to spend two seasons on the Football League as an assistant referee.

* Apparently I say 'Magic' a lot ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
