## Why?

In preparation for my new role as Business Agility Director @ [Cytora](https://cytora.com/) thought a lot about lessons I'd learned about building effective teams. First and foremost the Business Agility Team is a new team within Cytora so initially I was focused on getting myself, Max and Vlad working together effectively as quickly as possible. However, we cross organisational and team boundaries so it's also important that we work can work effectively with everyone in the organisation. Many people discover these ways of working through over time and through the experience of working with others, however, this can often be a long process during which there can be misunderstandings or even conflict between people who like to work in different ways or have different needs. Rather than be reactive and mediate and resolve this conflict once it arises I wanted to find a way to be pro-active and prevent that happening in the first place. A couple of years a go I remember coming across and a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@cassierobinson/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694) by [Cassie Robinson](https://medium.com/@cassierobinson) about a technique she had learned called a User Manual for me. At the time I was in a well established team by the idea has always stuck with me and was an obvious starting place for me new role.

There were some other reasons why I wanted to try the idea of a _User Manual for me_.

* It is well aligned with Kanban value of transparency.
* We often work with teams to improve the effectiveness in which they work together and I am a big believer in not asking anyone to do something that you aren't prepared to do yourself. I want a model of engagement where we invite other people to participate in change rather than impose it on them and one of the best ways I see of doing that is us setting the example, trying things out ourselves and reporting back on what we've learned, how it's helped us and how the tool/technique/practice might be applied more effectively in the future.


## Why publish it via GitHub?

First and foremost I wanted it to be public because well ...

* See _Things I Love_: "Working in the open".
* It wouldn't be much use if it was private and if someone has to come and ask me for the private link I think the effectiveness would be greatly reduced. 

So why Github and not somewhere else like Medium?

* So this is v1 of the manual, I expect to make changes over time and having the transparency of the revision history in Version Control really appeals to me.
* I work with a lot of Software Developers so I think there is using a tool which is familiar to them and if I want to extend it to be hosted on a static site that will be very straightforward.
* This manual is my current view of myself and how I like to work. It's subject to my biases and some of it may turn out not to be fully reflective of reality. It's as much for the people I work with as it is for me. Therefore, I wanted a way in which people who I interact with can suggest additions/edits based on their experience of working with me.
